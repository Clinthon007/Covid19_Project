# COVID19 ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW
This is a covid19 analysis projected to look into its cases, people vaccinated, people infected and countries infected, as well as people killed within that year, using _United States_ as case study.

### Data Source
The datasets used are the 'CovidDeaths.xlsx' [CovidDeaths](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx) and 'CovidVaccinations.xlsx' [CovidVaccinations](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx) files

### Tools Used

- EXCEL : was used to sort both data files since they were both contained in one bigger file. Therefore, excel was used to split these files to be individual files inorder to work on.
- MS SQL : was used to query the data inorder to get the appropriate information needed.
- TABLEAU Public: was used for final visualizations of the problem statements as concerned to me.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
 The following tasks were carried out;
 - Data Loading and inspection in EXCEL
 - Spliting of the whole data into two(2) different files for CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations respectively. This was done because both files were contained in a single file to be used in SQL for data extractions.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved the Covid19 data to answer some key questions, such as;

i. What are the **Total Cases** (Global Numbers)?

ii. What are the **Total Death Counts Per Continent**?

iii. What is the **Percentage Population Infected Per Country**?

iv. What is the **Average Infected Population Percentage**?
